# nonlocal_tests
It is intended that tests that can be conducted as part of continuous-integration tests on bitbucket/github be placed in the *nonlocal_tests* folder

N.B. The nonlocal_tests *may* require the ../local_tests/*py to have been produced first to generate intermediate output (esp. the schema files)
